In this project, I implemented a Java program that converts a file format to another. .csv(comma separated values) file 
to .txt(tab separated values) file, and vice versa. 

Program commands:

convert source.xxx destination.yyy: this command converts source.xxx to destination.yyy where source.xxx is the name and extension of the file that user wants to convert and destination.yyy is the name and extension of the file in which the user wants to store the result of format conversion

normalize source.xxx: this command reads the content of source.xxx, normalizes the content of each cell, and writes the normalized content back to the same file.

quit: ends the program

NOTE: In order to test the commands you must place files in the input and output folders as shown in my project, I have already placed test examples: test.csv in input and test.txt in output. For the conversion the input must be in the input folder and the output must be in the output folder when calling the method. The normalization method can find any file in both folders.
