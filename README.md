I have implemented the convert command, however I did not implement the conversion of a cell's content when enclosed in double qutations (e.g. "12,345" -> 12,345)
I have also implemented everything in the normalize command

NOTE: In order to test the commands you must place files in the input and output folders as shown in my project, I have already placed test examples: test.csv in input and test.txt in output. For the conversion the input must be in the input folder and the output must be in the output folder when calling the method. The normalization method can find any file in both folders.
